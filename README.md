MS_PS
=====

This program is the implementation of MSPS algorithm in Data Mining, Sequential pattern mining using multiple minimum supports with a support difference constraint. It is written in Java. 

### Input File Format

data.txt

<{1, 2, 3}{4}> -- This is a transaction / sequence

{1, 2, 5} -- represents an itemset and each number represents an individual item

para.txt

MIS(2) = 0.002 -- Minimum item support for item 2

SDC = 0.05 -- Support difference constraint value.
